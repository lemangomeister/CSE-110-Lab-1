## Who I Am As A Person
My name is Mico Guinto. As of the time I created this User Page, I am a 4th year (Transfer Student) Computer Engineering Major under Muir College at **University of California, San Diego**. If I had to explain myself in three words, it would be: 
> Introverted but Social. 

Some of my hobbies include:
<ol>
    <li>Enjoying intense competitive video games with friends</li>
    <li>Practicing Martial Arts</li>
    <li>And essentially anything that involves me using my legs</li>
</ol>

I also, sometimes, like to watch sports. The sports I pay attention to the most are:
<ul>
    <li>Ice Hockey (NHL)</li>
    <li>Basketball (NBA)</li>
    <li>Martial Arts Matches (ONE FC/UFC)</li>
</ul>

Some of the things I'd like to be able to do to improve myself are:
<ul>
    <li>Maintain a healthy body</li>
    <li>Improve culinary skills (Fast Food is now just convenient, not cheap anymore)</li>
    <li>Improve social skills</li>
</ul>

## Who I am As A Programmmer
I am aspiring to be an effective engineer not just in the software realm, but I also aspire to be involved with hardware as well. The courses I have taken relating to hardware have been interesting to the point that I am intrigued enough to explore more of the world of hardware, something I thought I would ever do. One of the things I struggle with as an aspiring engineer is maintaining `productivity` for a relatively long period of time.

Some of my current goals as a Computer Engineering Student:
- [x] Have a decent resume
- [ ] Acquire an internship
- [ ] Profit ????
